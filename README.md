Self-Balancing Robot – Complete 5-Manual Guide

A complete end-to-end educational series for building and understanding a Self-Balancing Robot using Arduino UNO, MPU6050, Complementary Filter, PID Control, and L293D Motor Driver.

This repository contains 5 highly detailed manuals that teach everything from fundamentals to full implementation.

Whether you are a beginner or an embedded systems engineer, this series will take you from theory → control systems → hardware → implementation → tuning → final working robot.
